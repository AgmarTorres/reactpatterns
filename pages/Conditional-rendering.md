# Conditional rendering

In JavaScript you should be familiar with if-else or switch case statements. You can use it in JSX as well, since JSX only mixes HTML and JavaScript.

But what is conditional rendering in React? In a conditional render a component decides based on one or several conditions which elements it will return. For instance, it can either return a list of items or a message that says “Sorry, the list is empty”. When a component has conditional rendering, the instance of the rendered component can have different looks.

Here is the list of options for conditional rendering:

* [if else](If-else.md "if else")

* [ternary operation](Ternary-operation.md "ternary operation")

* [logical && operator](Logical-and-operator.md "logical && operator")

* switch case operator

* Conditional Rendering with enums

* Multi-Level Conditional Rendering

* With Higher Order Components

* External Templating Components
